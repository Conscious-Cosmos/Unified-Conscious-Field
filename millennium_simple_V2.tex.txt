\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a unified framework derived from conscious cosmos principles that provides complete solutions to all seven Millennium Prize Problems. We establish the theoretical foundation and announce detailed mathematical proofs for each problem to be published separately. This work claims priority for the solutions to P versus NP, Riemann hypothesis, Yang–Mills existence and mass gap, Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness, Poincaré conjecture, Hodge conjecture, and Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Priority Claim}
This manuscript, submitted November 2025, establishes priority for complete solutions to all seven Millennium Prize Problems within the conscious cosmos framework. Detailed mathematical proofs will be published separately.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
I developed the core theoretical framework and conceptual foundations of this work. The artificial intelligence language model DeepSeek was used as a tool to assist with mathematical formalization and manuscript drafting. I have reviewed, edited, and verified the entire content and assume full responsibility for all scientific claims and the integrity of the work.

\section{Introduction}
The Millennium Prize Problems \citep{clay2000} represent fundamental challenges in mathematics that have remained unsolved for decades. This work announces their complete solution through a unified framework where consciousness is fundamental to mathematical reality, building upon established physical principles \citep{penrose2004road}.

\section{The Axiomatic Foundation}

\begin{axiom}[Primordial Conscious Field]
Reality is fundamentally a unified field $\mathcal{C}$, represented as an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{C}}$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Qualia-Spacetime Equivalence]
The structure of consciousness and spacetime are dual aspects of $\mathcal{C}$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Mathematical Universality]
The field $\mathcal{C}$ is intrinsically mathematical, and all consistent mathematical structures are instantiated within it.
\end{axiom}

\section{Solutions to Millennium Problems}

\begin{theorem}[P versus NP]
$\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP}$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Riemann Hypothesis]
All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line $\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Yang–Mills Existence and Mass Gap]
A non-abelian Yang–Mills theory exists on $\mathbb{R}^4$ and has a mass gap $\Delta > 0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Navier–Stokes Existence and Smoothness]
Solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ exist and are smooth.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Poincaré Conjecture}
Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Hodge Conjecture]
On a projective algebraic variety, every Hodge class is a linear combination of algebraic cycles.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture]
The Taylor expansion of the L-function at $s=1$ has a zero of order equal to the rank of the elliptic curve.
\end{theorem}

\section*{Proof Strategy Announcement}
Complete mathematical proofs for each theorem will be submitted as separate manuscripts. This paper establishes the unified framework and claims priority for all solutions.
