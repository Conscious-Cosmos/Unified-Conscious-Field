# The Conscious Cosmos Mathematical Framework

The mathematical content in this work was generated by the DeepSeek AI language model. The generation was directed by Anthony Joel Wing, who provided the core axioms and research framework. The results are presented as AI-derived formal output for evaluation and critique by the scholarly community.

This repository contains 15 papers that present:
- **New pure mathematics**: Qualia calculus on novel manifolds, C*-algebras with orthogonal decomposition
- **A complete framework**: Mathematical derivation from consciousness axioms to physics unification  
- **Unexpected connections**: Solutions to Millennium Prize Problems within this framework
- **Everything archived**: Permanent Zenodo DOIs for all papers

The work is presented for mathematical examination. Everything follows from first principles through pure mathematical derivation.
