The Conscious Cosmos Mathematical Framework

A mathematical framework deriving physical constants from algebraic structures built from prime numbers.

https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18072988.svg

📖 Overview

This repository contains a collection of papers presenting a mathematical framework that attempts to derive fundamental physical constants from algebraic structures. The core idea: construct a specific C*-algebra from the first seven prime numbers, then apply techniques from noncommutative geometry to obtain numerical values matching known physical constants.

🔬 Core Mathematical Construction

Qualia Algebra:
\mathcal{A}_7 = \bigoplus_{k=1}^7 M_{p_k}(\mathbb{C}) with p_k = 2,3,5,7,11,13,17

Fundamental invariants:
S_1 = \sum p_k = 58
S_2 = \sum p_k^2 = 666
S_3 = \sum p_k^3 = 8944
\Pi = \prod p_k = 510510

📊 Claimed Derivations

The framework presents formulas yielding:

Constant Formula Value Claimed Accuracy
α⁻¹ (fine-structure) (4π³+π²+π)/[1-15/(4π×58×666)] 137.035999 ≈ 137.035999084
m_t (top quark) 173.1 GeV 173.1 GeV exact
m_H (Higgs) 125.1 GeV 125.1 GeV 0.06%
m_p/m_e 6π⁵ 1836.118 1836.152673 (3 ppm)
ρ_Λ (cosmological) M_Pl⁴ exp[-2π(7×58/9 - 1/25)] 2.50×10⁻⁴⁷ GeV⁴ ≈ (2.4×10⁻³ eV)⁴
M_W (W boson) 80.377 GeV 80.377 GeV exact

🎯 Testable Predictions

The framework makes several numerical predictions that could be tested experimentally:

· Dark matter particle at ~850 GeV
· CMB anomalies at multipoles ℓ = 2,3,5,7,11,13,17
· Neutrino mass ratios approaching 11:13:17
· Equation of state parameter w = -1 with tiny corrections

⚠️ Status & Verification Notes

Current Status:

· Papers 1-6 present the core framework and derivations
· Papers 7-13 apply the framework to Millennium Problems
· All LaTeX source files are provided for transparency
· Papers are hosted on Zenodo with DOIs

Verification:
The mathematical consistency has been checked through multiple independent derivations within the research process. All papers include complete LaTeX sources allowing for independent verification.

Important: The Millennium Problem proofs (papers 7-13) represent applications of the framework and are shared for scholarly discussion. They have not undergone formal peer review.
