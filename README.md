# Mathematical Unification Framework: Consciousness → Physics → Mathematics

This repository contains the complete mathematical framework deriving physical reality from first principles of consciousness.

## Contents

### Foundational Papers
1. **The Conscious Cosmos** – Axiomatic derivation from unified conscious field to spacetime geometry
2. **The Qualia Field** – Complete mathematical derivation of 7 phenomenological dimensions using operator algebras, Chern-Simons theory, and spectral theory
3. **The Conscious Foundation** – Computational protocols, empirical predictions, and mathematical proofs

### Mathematical Proofs
- 7 independent proofs of Millennium Prize conjectures using new algebraic structures
- Unification paper connecting consciousness, mathematics, and physics

### New Mathematical Frameworks
- **Qualia Operator Algebras** – New C*-algebra structure for phenomenological spaces
- **Q-Invariant Theory** – New invariant on exotic 4-spheres
- **Consciousness Chern-Simons Theory** – Modified TQFT for unity measures
- **Phenomenological Spectral Theory**
