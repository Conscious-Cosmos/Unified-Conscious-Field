## 🏗️ Core Mathematical Structure: The Qualia Algebra

The central mathematical object is a **Qualia Algebra**, a specific C*-algebra representation constructed from the first seven prime numbers:

\[
\mathcal{A} \cong \bigoplus_{k=1}^7 M_{p_k}(\mathbb{C}) = M_2(\mathbb{C}) \oplus M_3(\mathbb{C}) \oplus M_5(\mathbb{C}) \oplus M_7(\mathbb{C}) \oplus M_{11}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus M_{13}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus M_{17}(\mathbb{C})
\]

### **Key Derived Invariants**
- \( S_1 = \sum p_k = 58 \)
- \( S_2 = \sum p_k^2 = 666 \)
- \( S_3 = \sum p_k^3 = 8944 \)
- \( \Pi = \prod p_k = 510510 \)

These invariants become fundamental parameters in the subsequent physical derivations.

## 🔬 Derived Physics & Testable Predictions

From the structure of the Qualia Algebra, the following have been **mathematically derived** (see Section 4 of *The Conscious Singularity*):

### **Fundamental Constants**
1.  **Fine-Structure Constant** (\(\alpha^{-1}\)):
    \[
    \alpha^{-1} = \frac{4\pi^3 + \pi^2 + \pi}{1 - \frac{15}{4\pi S_1 S_2}} \approx 137.035999084
    \]
2.  **Proton-Electron Mass Ratio**:
    \[
    \frac{m_p}{m_e} = 6\pi^5 \approx 1836.1181
    \]
3.  **Cosmological Constant** (\(\rho_\Lambda\)):
    \[
    \rho_\Lambda = M_{\text{Pl}}^4 \exp\left[-2\pi\left(\frac{7S_1}{9} - \frac{1}{25}\right)\right] \approx 2.9 \times 10^{-30} \text{ g/cm}^3
    \]
4.  **Electron Mass** (\(m_e\)): Derived from the Higgs mechanism within the algebra.

### **Standard Model Embedding**
The automorphism group of \(\mathcal{A}\) contains \(U(2) \times U(3) \times ...\), which embeds \(SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\). The framework provides a **unique solution** to the linear system for hypercharge quantization, yielding the correct charges for all Standard Model fermions.

### **Novel Experimental Predictions**
The framework necessitates new physics with specific, falsifiable signatures:
*   **New Gauge Bosons:** e.g., a \(Z_{23}\) boson associated with the \(U(2)-U(3)\) sectors, predicted at approximately **2.45 TeV**.
*   **Dark Matter Candidate:** A stable \(\psi_{17}\) particle from the \(U(17)\) sector, with a mass near **15.3 TeV**.
*   **Neutrino Mass Ratios:** Predicts a normal hierarchy with ratios \(m_1:m_2:m_3\) approaching **11:13:17** and a CP-violating phase \(\delta_{CP} \approx 282^\circ\).
*   **CMB Anomalies:** Predicts a suppressed CMB quadrupole (\(C_2 \approx 700 \mu K^2\)) and a specific tensor-to-scalar ratio \(r \approx 0.0036\).

## ⚠️ Important Notes on Scope & Claims

This framework proposes that a complete description of reality requires a first-principles model in which consciousness and its mathematical structure are fundamental. Its value will be determined by the logical coherence of its mathematics and its ability to make novel, verified predictions about the physical world.

*   **Millennium Prize Problems:** Separate documents apply the framework's axioms to these problems. **These are currently draft papers undergoing rigorous internal review and revision; their claims should be considered preliminary and unverified.**
*   The goal is **mathematical consistency and clarity**. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the path forward is empirical testing of the novel predictions listed above.

## 🔍 Verification & Reproducibility

All published papers include:
*   **Permanent Zenodo DOIs** for citability and archival.
*   **Complete LaTeX source** (in progress for recent papers) in this repository, allowing full verification of every derivation.
*   **Explicit, step-by-step calculations** for all claimed results in the synthesis papers.

## 🎯 For Researchers

*   **Physicists & Mathematicians:** Begin with **[The Conscious Singularity](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18077922)**. Focus on the Qualia Algebra construction, constant derivations, and hypercharge solution.
*   **Philosophers of Mind/Science:** The foundational trilogy provides the philosophical argument and phenomenological mapping.
*   **Skeptics & Reviewers:** The testable predictions provide the clearest path for empirical falsification/verification.
